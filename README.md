# Weather Extension for Albert Launcher

Original extension: https://github.com/AlbertExtensions/Forecast

Albert Launcher: https://albertlauncher.github.io/

## My changes

I only changed a few values coming from the Openweathermap API:
* got rid of Â°F values
* included cloudiness
* included wind speed and direction

(Additionally, I changed a few things to German)

## How to install the extension
```
git clone https://github.com/doktorhorst/Albert-Wetter ~/.local/share/albert/org.albert.extension.python/modules/Forecast
```
